        <p class="lead mb-4">Ceylon is inhabited by various peoples, though the majority of the people are the Sinhalese belonging to the Kingdom of Kandy. There are also some Arab traders who have migrated and settled themselves in Ceylon. The Sinhalese are Buddhist, the Tamils are Hindus, and the Arabians are Islamic. As a result of the inevitable cultural mingling in Ceylon, Hinduism practiced by the Tamils varies from those of the Indians, as they do not fully believe in the doctrine of rebirth. Hindus typically cremate their dead to ensure their loved ones are able to be reborn. However, rather than cremating their dead, the Tamils bury their corpses beneath or near their homes. Furthermore, as there are no apparent Christian communities in Ceylon, our colonization of the island will entail the conversion of the Sinhalese and Tamil to Christianity. With added converts, we will be able to make Christianity a global religion. However, conversion may be a hard feat considering that Buddhism is a very important part of Sinhalese culture. Besides the religions the Sinhalese practice, they have works known as Pali literature. These novels are constructed out of palm leaves, which is quite ingenious considering that they do not have the same technology as we have for proper paper making. They also have extensive stories of folklore about national heroes and saints. Along with their stories and folktales, the Sinhalese have managed to build elaborate and eloquent pieces of art and architecture. Their art and architecture is greatly reminiscent of the structures and pieces we see in India. Yet, because of their geographical and reclusive position on the map, the Sinhalese are not exposed to new ideals of us, the Europeans. Domination of the island will allow us to establish Christianity as one of the staple religions in Ceylon, and with the institution of our new colonies, we will be able to implement our ideals as one of the main cultures that are prominent in Ceylon. The institution of our colonies will also need the removal of many architecture that the Sinhalese have constructed, as we will need ample space for our plantations, trading centers, and other ventures as well. Furthermore, most Sinhalese people are clothed in swaths of robes, which are not as civilized compared to the formal and proper attire that we don on a daily basis. The various people that visit Ceylon, such as merchants from China and Southeast Asia, will also diffuse their cultures to the indigenous peoples. Since merchants from Asia have a likeness to the indigenous, Asian beliefs and ideals will not cause a large impact on existing Ceylon cultures. After all, many of the indigenous originate from the places that Asian merchants arrive from. As we settle into this new colony, we will slowly introduce and assimilate the Sinhalese, as well as the Tamil into our ways to ensure that life for us English will be smooth and easy.<br><br>
